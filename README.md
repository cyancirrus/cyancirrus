Hi, I’m Raven (Autumn / Raven Echo)

[`🌿 blog`](https://cyancirrus.github.io/autumn_leaves.io/)

Currently diving deep into:
- Mathematical & scientific computing  
- Neural networks, numerical methods, and control theory  
- Low-level systems: Rust, C, CUDA, shaders, and async patterns  
- High-performance linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and SVD  

Building a Rust-based compute ecosystem from scratch:
- Neural nets with no external ML libraries  
- `stellar-math` — a custom BLAS/FFT backend  
- Experiments with stochastic SVD, differentiable logic nets, and GPU acceleration  

Expanding into:
- GPU compute (CUDA kernels + Rust FFI)  
- Real-time simulation & control (pendulum balancing, state estimation)  
- Parser/AST building in Rust  
- Async-safe data structures (LRU caches, arenas, relaxed-read concurrency)  

Sharpening fundamentals with daily LeetCode practice:  
- Focused on dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and memory-lean solutions — tracked in [`algo`](https://github.com/cyancirrus/algo/tree/main/solutions).

🛠 Key projects:
- **neural-net** — From-scratch neural network in Rust  
- **stellar-math** — Low-level math backend (linear algebra, decompositions, FFT)  
- **algo** — Daily algorithm practice in Rust  
- **lru-cache** — Unsafe Rust exploration into pointers & memory management  
- **wordle** — Word search & constraint solver in Rust  
- **infra_as_code** — AWS Lambda infrastructure in JS  
- **py-template** — Python package starter template  

All of this is scaffolding toward replicating research, writing better abstractions, and building expressive tools for scientific computing.

Always happy to talk about numerics, HPC, Rust’s borrow checker, async, or low-level GPU work.

Algorithm questions? I’m probably mid-problem — but feel free to reach out! 😅
