ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cyancirrus (autumn)

ðŸ§  Iâ€™m deep in the weeds of:
- mathematical & scientific computing
- neural networks and numerical methods
- low-level systems and optimization
- SVD, matrix ops, and signal processing

ðŸ¦€ Currently building out a Rust-based ecosystem:
- neural nets from scratch (no libraries)
- a custom BLAS-like math backend
- high-performance transforms and linear algebra routines

ðŸ“š Lately, Iâ€™ve been sharpening my fundamentals with daily LeetCode:
- Focused on dynamic programming, graph theory, and tricky systems questions
- Iâ€™m pushing to my `algos` repo with real-world-strength Rust solutions
- Sample problems: `merge_k_lists.rs`, `ocean_flow.rs`, `sudoku_bitmask.rs`, `spiral_matrix.rs`, `levenshtein.rs`, `permutations.rs`, and dozens more

ðŸ”¬ I treat these as warmups for larger ambitions: designing optimized, expressive abstractions for scientific computing and replicating complex research results from white papers.

ðŸ’¬ Always up for discussions about:
- numerical methods, HPC, or autodiff
- how to bend Rustâ€™s borrow checker to your will
- turning ML research into robust systems
