👋 Hi, I’m @cyancirrus (Autumn / Raven Echo)

🧠 Deeply immersed in:
- Mathematical & scientific computing
- Neural networks and numerical methods
- Low-level systems and performance optimization
- SVD, matrix operations, and signal processing

🦀 Building a Rust-based ecosystem from scratch:
- Neural nets without external libraries
- Custom BLAS-like math backend (`stellar-math`)
- High-performance linear algebra and Fourier transforms

📚 Sharpening fundamentals with daily LeetCode challenges:  
- Focused on dynamic programming, graph theory, and complex systems — solutions live in my [`algo`](https://github.com/cyancirrus/algo) repo.

🛠 Key projects pinned on my profile:
- **neural-net** — From-scratch neural network implementation in Rust  
- **stellar-math** — Math backend exploring linear algebra decompositions and transforms  
- **algo** — Daily DSA problem-solving in Rust  
- **wordle** — Quick unique word search tool in Rust  
- **infra_as_code** — AWS Lambda infrastructure with JavaScript  
- **py-template** — Python package starter template

🔬 These are warmups and stepping stones toward replicating complex research and building expressive abstractions for scientific computing.

💬 Open to discussions on numerical methods, HPC, autodiff, and mastering Rust’s borrow checker.
