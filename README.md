ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cyancirrus {autumn}

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m diving deep into {mathematical computing, machine learning, low-level programming, neural networks, SVD algorithms}

ðŸŒ± Currently exploring {Rust, numerical methods, high-performance computing, replicating results from white papers}

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m building a neural network from scratch in Rustâ€”no libraries, just pure code.

ðŸ“š Iâ€™ve completed the SVD algorithm and Iâ€™m working on more robust and optimized methods for linear algebra problems.

ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m open to collaborations on {scientific computing, low-level algorithm design, optimization techniques, and computational theory}.

ðŸ“« Reach me on Discord: autumn#3467

If your first thought is to ask me an algorithm problem, please be kindâ€”Iâ€™m in the weeds with numerical methods!
